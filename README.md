#Pridi Font

Pridi means joyful.

Pridi is a Slab Serif Latin and Looped Thai typeface that is well-suited for both body text and display. Loop Terminal Thai, designed specifically within Loopless terminal concept, works well with Slab Serif Latin without adding the Slab to any parts of Thai glyphs. This font can be used as a body text in various media such as magazine, advertisement, and other print media.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal one, so this allows designers to extend the font to black weight and more in some cases.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Ttfautohint supports Thai hinting process efficiently. It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended. For more information, visit http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

The Pridi project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/pridi
