#Pridi Font

The objective of this project is to create a informal Serif Latin and Looped Thai typeface. Pridi is a humanist slab serif family with subtle details. Itâ€™s optimized for longer texts and highly readable in small sizes. Thai alphabet was specifically designed with a latin structure but without slab terminal part. The family consists of 6 weights, ranging from ExtraLight to Bold. For further development, this typeface can be extended the family to italic, slant, narrow and extended version, it can also be matched with other non-Latin script.
